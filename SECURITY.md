# Security

At Calibre, we believe security and privacy are critically important. To ensure we provide the best possible protection, we ask for responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities in our projects. Thank you for participating and helping us keep Calibre safe!

While at this point, we don’t have a bug bounty program, we will make sure that every report is evaluated and addressed.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

⚠️ **Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.** ⚠️

Instead, please send an email to security[@]calibreapp.com.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

* The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
