## 👋🏻 Hello there
We are ♠️ [Calibre](https://calibreapp.com/): an (intentionally) small company building a **web performance platform to help create faster, more equitable internet**. 

Our team has a long history of community organising, from open source contributions and facilitation (for example, projects like Ruby on Rails, Bower and Node.js) to organising dozens of international events (such as JSConf and CSSConf). 

We feel at home when helping people, and GitHub is one of the places where we do it.

### 💓 Giving back to the ecosystem
Because we believe in paying it forward, we actively work on building tools to benefit people and teams interested in improving web performance and user experience. Here are our favourite projects:

* **[Calibre CLI](https://github.com/calibreapp/cli):** a command-line interface and Node.js API for Calibre data and actions.
* **[Image Actions](https://github.com/calibreapp/image-actions/):** a GitHub Action that automatically optimises your images in pull requests.
* **[React Live Chat Loader](https://github.com/calibreapp/react-live-chat-loader/):** an npm module that mitigates the negative performance impact of chat tools.

We also contribute to existing tools, such as [Google Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) or [Chrome HAR](https://github.com/sitespeedio/chrome-har). Beyond GitHub, we run 📬 [a fortnightly page speed newsletter](https://perf.email/) and regularly publish 📝 [high-quality content about speed](https://calibreapp.com/blog/category/web-performance).
