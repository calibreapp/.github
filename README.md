## ⛔️ What’s NOT in this repository

### `LICENSE`
The license defines what others can and cannot do with open source code. All of our public repositories **should have a carefully chosen license file**. Because the [type of license](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) will largely depend on the project, it’s been omitted here and should be added manually when you create one.
